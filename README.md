angry-book-man
==============

A simple bookmark manager example powered by AngularJS, PHP, and any database.  Includes basic concept of a Model, View, and Controller. Along with a data model in the browser and a RESTful JSON interface.

Why "Angry"?
==============
Because it uses AngularJS I took the "Ang" from Angular and chose a different word.

Steps to Use
==============
3. Run the angrybookman.sql file to set up the database. It should work in any typical SQL database like MySQL, PostegrSQL or MariaDB.
3. Copy settings.sample.php to settings.php and modify the environment specific variables (database name, username, password)
4. Run start.sh in a shell, assuming you have PHP 5.4+ ready to use on your system.

This will fire up a local PHP webserver instance.
